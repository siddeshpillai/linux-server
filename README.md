Required Software
If you've already downloaded and installed these items, perhaps while completing a different course, you do not need to download and install these items again.

Download and install VirtualBox. This is free software that will run the virtual machine.
Download and install Vagrant. This is an command line utility that makes it easy to manage and access your virtual machines.

Note: Currently (July 2018), the version of VirtualBox you will want is 5.2. Newer versions do not yet support Vagrant.

Follow these steps to setup an environment where you can work on this course:

1. Create a new folder on your computer where youâ€™ll store your work for this course, then open that folder within your terminal.
2. Type vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64 to tell Vagrant what kind of Linux virtual machine you would like to run.
3. Type vagrant up to download and start running the virtual machine
